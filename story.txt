I couldn't open the Schloss brand lock on my Schloss, so I went out on the town.
Lost and without a home, I headed to the local Ratskreller to drink my favorite Apfelschorle
I was hungry, so I ordered Bratwurst to eat.
Before I could eat my Bratwurst, a hund jumped in from behind and took it!
I pulled up the straps on my Lederhose and chased after it before slipping on a plate of Apfelkuchen! :o
After embarrassing myself I decided to give up on the Bratwurst and go to the Baeckerei.
As I walk to the Baerckerei, I hear in the distance my favorite band Rammstein playing.
There's always something interesting going on in Berlin. I need a break from it all, so I walk to the Flughafen.
On the way to the Flughafen I noticed a Biergarten, and decided to stop for a drink.
As I walk across the street to the Biergarten, a Porche comes flying down the road and hit me leaving me to die in street. However, a passerby witnessed the whole scene and was able to call the police. After 6 months of healing in the hosital I was able to sue the man who hit me for a large sum of money, enough to have a locksmith come open my Schloss.
Now I drive around in a BMW.

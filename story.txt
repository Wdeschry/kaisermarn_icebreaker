I couldn't open the Schloss brand lock on my Schloss, so I went out on the town.
Lost and without a home, I headed to the local Ratskreller to drink my favorite Apfelschorle
I was hungry, so I ordered Bratwurst to eat.
Before I could eat my Bratwurst, a hund jumped in from behind and took it!
I pulled up the straps on my Lederhose and chased after it before slipping on a plate of Apfelkuchen! :o
After embarrassing myself I decided to give up on the Bratwurst and go to the Baeckerei.
As I walk to the Baerckerel, I hear in the distance my favorite band Rammstein playing.
